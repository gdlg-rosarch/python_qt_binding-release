Description: This stack provides Python bindings for Qt. There are two providers: pyqt and pyside. PyQt is released under the GPL, which can be too restrictive. Therefore this package also provides PySide when available. PySide uses the LGPL license, but is not available via normal Debian package channels on Ubuntu Lucid. Both the bindings and tools to build bindings are included from each available provider. For PyQt, this is called &quot;SIP&quot;. For PySide, it is called &quot;Shiboken&quot; (and other tools). Also provided is adapter code to make the user's Python code independent of which binding provider was actually used.
